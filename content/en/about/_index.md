Before I started my journey as a data detective, I worked as a junior researcher at the IVDMR lab which affects my current work, always turning back to up-to-date research and placing value in evidence-based decisions. Coming from psychology background, I keep in mind that behind all the data, there is always a person to understand which helps me look at the data from a wider perspective.

Apart from data, I engage in multiple other passions, including composing and producing my own music, or photography. Music always played a big role in bringing authenticity, raw emotions, and creative playfulness into my life. My time-management skills, daily dose of yoga and meditation also help me tremendously to sustain a healthy and balanced lifestyle, which I hope to incorporate professionally into my work in the future. And as a knowledge seeker speaking, I hope the journey to gain more skills and knowledge to never end.
