I work as a **data analyst / scientist**. I hold a **psychology** degree from Masaryk University.

Before data related work, I worked as a **junior researcher** at the IVDMR lab and conducted a research project with an international team under Junior Researcher Programme which affects my current work, always turning back to up-to-date research and placing value in evidence-based and data-driven decisions. My psychology background helps me look at the data from a wider perspective. I also focus on aligning my career with principles of effective altruism, as I currently volunteer for Faunalytics as a data scientist. You can check my resume for further details [here](/files/Hlavova_resume.pdf).

Apart from data, I engage in multiple other passions, including **composing and producing my own music**, or **photography**. To stay organised handling multiple projects, I follow GTD (Getting Things Done) approach. Daily dose of **yoga and meditation** also help me tremendously to sustain a healthy and balanced lifestyle. And as a knowledge seeker speaking, I hope the journey to gain more skills and knowledge to never end.
