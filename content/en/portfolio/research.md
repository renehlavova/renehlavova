**At the moment, I am not active in any research project.** 

Historically, I was a part of multiple projects with differing topics as my main interest was tied to quantitative data analysis and statistics.

The latest news is a release of **Psychology and Behavioral Economics** (2021) textbook where I worked on two chapters, *Education and behavior* and *Evidence-based policy*. It is aimed to help get an idea how to use behavioural science in public policy.

Below, you can find examples of other projects. For further details, please check [Google Schoolar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7-XVaQ0AAAAJ), or [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Renata-Hlavova).
