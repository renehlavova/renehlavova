Since 2019, I work as a data analyst.

&nbsp;

My journey started while conducting research at university - I realized I enjoy playing with the data the most. I spent countless hours on DataCamp, Coursera, and other platforms trying to learn **Python** to be able to combine it with my **statistical knowledge**. 

In [Kiwi.com](https://www.kiwi.com/en/pages/content/about), I had a chance to get my hands dirty with almost anything related to data. I prepared data models **(ETLs)** in **Keboola** or **Airflow**, analyses in **Jupyter notebooks**, dashboards in **GoodData** or **Looker**, wrote a lot of **SQL**, and even played with some **HTML** and **JavaScript** when working with Retool. After nearly two years, I was helping more junior colleagues with **Git**, coding, and was even a Looker ambassador, responsible for dashboard quality prepared by our team.

In [Seznam](https://o.seznam.cz/en/about-us/), I had an opportunity to work with big data, specifically from full-text search. I used **PySpark** and **Jupyter** on a daily basis, built dashboards in **Tableau**, and became best friends with the command line.

At the moment, I focus on expanding my skills in data science.
