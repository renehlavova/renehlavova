I am a **data professional** with experience building **end-to-end data projects** for small businesses. 

I am skilled in building **ETL/ELT** pipelines (**Keboola**, **Airflow**), defining the logical data model and designing dashboards in various tools (preferably **Looker** or **Tableau**, but can handle **PowerBI** and **GoodData** as well). I am confident in **SQL** as well as **Python** for getting data from **API** or websites (**scraping**). For example, I wrote extractors for SoundCloud, Google Reviews, Keboola API, or Copper CRM.

I also worked with big data using **PySpark**, and was a **Looker ambassador**, responsible for dashboard quality prepared by our team. I guided junior colleagues with **Git** and coding reviews, and took part in [Czechitas Digital Academy](https://www.czechitas.cz/tema/digitalni-akademie) as a **mentor**.

In general, I can provide consultations on data-related topics, incl. **data quality, architecture and infrastructure**. I have actively sought out opportunities to expand my knowledge and expertise, which has allowed me to adapt quickly to new challenges. For example, I participated on developing **full-stack data applications**, to either generate automatic documentation for data projects, or to validate client's data and integrate them into his internal system. I am always eager to take on new responsibilities and embrace fresh perspectives, as they allow me to broaden my horizons and enhance my contributions. **My goal is to bring a versatile skill set to any role or project I undertake**.

Currently, **I am a part of a team of data detectives in [BizzTreat](https://www.bizztreat.com)** (2021 - today). Previous years, I worked for **[Kiwi.com](https://www.kiwi.com/en/pages/content/about)** (2019 - 2021), and **[Seznam](https://o.seznam.cz/en/about-us/)** (2021). I also volunteered for **[Faunalytics](https://faunalytics.org)** as a Data Science / Statistician volunteer (2020-2021).

At the moment, I focus on expanding my skills in data engineering and programming.
