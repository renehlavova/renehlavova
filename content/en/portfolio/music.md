I started playing piano at the age of 6 at a local art school. Over the years, I did gigs with two musical bands and performed in caf√©s around Brno (Czech Republic), but did not continue to study music professionally.

During psychology studies, my activities were still centered around music - I organized musical activities for child psychiatry patients, conducted a research project related to music and well-being in the elderly, or helped conceptualize music therapy studies at University of Ostrava. 

Soon I started to miss music when being on the road, so I took on other more compact instruments, such as ukulele and guitalele. Sometimes I try to sing as well, and am on the quest of learning to sing loudly (which I deeply apologize for to my neighbours).

Recently I started recording my piano improvisations. After some time I had forgotten about them, and when I found them a couple of years later, I thought wow that is nice, I wonder who wrote that. *And that is how I became a composer.* 

I think of music as a tool towards more authenticity. Music helps me express myself and feel free, in contrast to my overthinking data analyst side. Thus most of my material is raw, not much edited, not even really composed - because all of the compositions came from emotions tied to the specific moment. And any further edits would mean loosing the moment.
