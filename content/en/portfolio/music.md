I started playing piano at the age of 6 at a local art school. Then I did gigs with two musical bands and performed in caf√©s around Brno (Czech Republic), but did not continue to study music professionally.

However, during psychology studies, my activities were centered around music - I organized musical activities for child psychiatry patients, conducted a research project related to music and well-being in the elderly, or helped conceptualize music therapy studies at University of Ostrava. 

Soon I started to miss music when being on the road, so I took on other more compact instruments, such as ukulele and guitalele. Sometimes I try to sing as well, and am on the quest of learning to sing loudly (which I deeply apologize for to my neighbours).

Recently I started recording my piano improvisations. After some time I had forgotten about them, and when I found them a couple of years later, I thought wow that is nice, I wonder who wrote that. *And that is how I became a composer.* 

I think of music as a tool towards more authenticity. When I let go of all barriers and stop thinking for a second, music helps me express myself and feel free, in contrast to my overthinking data analyst side. Thus most my material is raw, not much edited, not even really composed - because all of the compositions came from emotions tied to the specific moment. And any further edits would mean loosing the moment. 

You can look forward to a piano album **Dialogues I**, which will be released later this year. **You can already listen to the first dialogue [Crossroads](https://youtu.be/kIEhVDfyJ0o)**.
