I am currently working on a set of piano compositions called Dialogues. 

**You can already listen to the first two Dialogues here:**

**But I am no educated composer**. As a little kid, I started playing the piano. Soon I took on other instruments, including ukulele or guitalele. Over the years, I did gigs with some musical bands and performed in cafÃ©s, but did not continue to study music professionally. Sometimes I try to sing as well, and am on the quest of learning to sing loudly (which I deeply apologize for to my neighbours).

During psychology studies, my activities were still centered around music - I organized musical activities for child psychiatry patients, conducted a research project related to music and well-being, or helped conceptualize music therapy studies at a university.

Once I started recording my piano improvisations. After some time I had forgotten about them, and when I found them a couple of years later, I thought wow that is nice, I wonder who wrote that. *And that is how I became a composer.*

> *I think of music as a tool towards authenticity. Music helps me express emotions that I do not understand. It stands in contrast to my overthinking analytical side which always has an answer. I like my music raw, not much edited, not even really composed - because all of the compositions are tied to the specific moment that hit me somehow. And any further edits would mean loosing the moment.*
