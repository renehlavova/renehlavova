At age 6, I started taking piano lessons at a local art school. I spent my childhood and teenage years playing and practising, but due to life circumstances I never went to study music professionally. 

Since then, music kept finding its way back to my life. I did countless gigs with two musical bands, [Prevazne nevazne](https://www.facebook.com/Převážně-Nevážně-69592259951) (2009 - 2010) and [Gentlemen's club](https://www.facebook.com/GentlemensClubSKA) (2012 - 2016). 
Even during psychology studies, I organized musical activities for child psychiatry patients, conducted a research project related to music and well-being in the elderly, helped conceptualize music therapy studies at University of Ostrava, and performed in cafés around Brno. 

Soon I started to miss music when being on the road, so I took on other more compact instruments, such as ukulele and guitalele. Sometimes I try to sing as well, and am on the quest of learning to sing loudly (which I deeply apologize for to my neighbours).

Recently I started recording my piano improvisations. After some time I had forgotten about them, and when I found them a couple of years later, I thought wow that is nice, I wonder who wrote that. *And that is how I became a composer.* 

I think of music as a tool towards more authenticity. When I let go of all barriers and stop thinking for a second, music helps me express myself and feel free, in contrast to my overthinking data analyst side. Thus most my material is raw, not much edited, not even really composed - because all of the compositions came from emotions tied to the specific moment. And any further edits would mean loosing the moment. 

You can look forward to a piano album Dialogues I, which I will be releasing later this year (2021).
