I am currently working on a set of piano compositions called **Dialogues**. 

**You can already listen to the first two Dialogues here:**

**But I am no educated composer**. I started playing the piano as a kid. Soon I took on other instruments, including ukulele or guitalele. Over the years, I did gigs with some musical bands and performed in caf√©s, but did not continue to study music professionally. 

During psychology studies, my activities were still centered around music. I organized musical activities for child psychiatry patients, conducted a research project related to music and well-being, or helped conceptualize music therapy studies at a university.

Once I started recording my piano improvisations. After some time I had forgotten about them, and when I found them a couple of years later, I thought wow that is nice, I wonder who wrote that. *And that is how, for me, I became a composer.* 

There is a story behind every piece. **I hope it helps you find yours.**
