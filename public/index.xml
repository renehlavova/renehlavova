      <description>I come from social sciences background and my programming skills are self-learnt. Recently, I joined a team of data detectives in BizzTreat (2021 - today). Previous years, I worked for Kiwi.com (2019 - 2021), and Seznam (2021).
I am skilled in preparing data models (ETLs) in Keboola or Airflow, statistical analyses in Jupyter notebooks, dashboards in GoodData, Tableau, Looker or PowerBI, wrote a lot of SQL, and even played with some HTML and JavaScript when working with Retool.</description>

      <description>I started playing piano at the age of 6 at a local art school. Over the years, I did gigs with two musical bands and performed in caf√©s around Brno (Czech Republic), but did not continue to study music professionally.
During psychology studies, my activities were still centered around music - I organized musical activities for child psychiatry patients, conducted a research project related to music and well-being in the elderly, or helped conceptualize music therapy studies at University of Ostrava.</description>

      <description>As my main interest is tied to quantitative data analysis, statistics, and data science, I was a part of multiple projects with differing topics.
The latest news is a release of Psychology and Behavioral Economics (2021) textbook where I worked on two chapters, Education and behavior and Evidence-based policy. It is aimed to help get an idea how to use behavioural science in public policy.
Below, you can find other example projects.</description>
