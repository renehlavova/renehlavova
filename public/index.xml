      <description>I come from social sciences background and my programming skills are self-learnt.
Currently, I am a part of a team of data detectives in BizzTreat (2021 - today). Previous years, I worked for Kiwi.com (2019 - 2021), and Seznam (2021).
I am skilled in preparing data models (ETLs) in Keboola or Airflow, statistical analyses in Jupyter notebooks, or dashboards in GoodData, Tableau, Looker and PowerBI. I am confident writing SQL, can handle Python, and even played with some HTML and JavaScript when working with Retool.</description>

      <description>I am currently working on a set of piano compositions called Dialogues.
You can already listen to the first two Dialogues here:
      But I am no educated composer. As a little kid, I started playing the piano. Soon I took on other instruments, including ukulele or guitalele. Over the years, I did gigs with some musical bands and performed in cafés, but did not continue to study music professionally.</description>

      <description>At the moment, I am not active in any research project.
Historically, I was a part of multiple projects with differing topics as my main interest was tied to quantitative data analysis and statistics.
The latest news is a release of Psychology and Behavioral Economics (2021) textbook where I worked on two chapters, Education and behavior and Evidence-based policy. It is aimed to help get an idea how to use behavioural science in public policy.</description>
